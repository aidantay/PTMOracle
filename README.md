PTMOracle is a Cytoscape app that facilitates the co-visualisation and co-analysis of post-translational modifications (PTMs) in the context of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. It allows users to develop systematic searches for proteins of interest and explore network visualisations that address complex PTM-associated relationships.
